# Visualization Study Case

In this project, I'll be working with a dataset regarding the prices and attributes of 
approximately 54,000 round-cut diamonds. I'll go through the steps of an explanatory 
data visualization, systematically starting from univariate visualizations, moving through 
bivariate visualizations, and finally multivariate visualizations. 
Finally, I'll work on polishing up selected plots from the analysis so 
that their main points can be clearly conveyed to others people.

For the case study, I will concentrate only the variables in the top five bullet points: 
price and the four 'C's of diamond grade. 
My focus will be on answering the question about the degree of importance that each of 
these quality measures has on the pricing of a diamond. 

### Dataset description

The dataset consists of almost 54,000 rows and 10 columns:

* price: Price in dollars. Data was collected in 2008.
* carat: Diamond weight. 1 carat is equal to 0.2 grams.
* cut: Quality of diamond cut, affects its shine. Grades go from (low) Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal (best).
* color: Measure of diamond coloration. Increasing grades go from (some color) J, I, H, G, F, E, D (colorless).
* clarity: Measure of diamond inclusions. Increasing grades go from (inclusions) I, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (internally flawless).
* x, y, z: Diamond length, width, and depth, respectively, in mm.
* table: Ratio of width of top face of diamond to its overall width, as a percentage.
* depth: Proportional depth of diamond, as a percentage. This is computed as 2 * z / (x + y), or the ratio of the depth to the average of length and width.
